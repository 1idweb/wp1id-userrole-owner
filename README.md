# 1id. Add User Role « _Owner_ »

This **Wordpress Plugin** adds an `Owner` user role with the same capabilities as an `editor`, plus the ability to **manage users**.

So by default the _Owner_ will not have access to the site’s _Plugins_ and _Themes_ repository unless he first modifies his role as `administrator`.
Meaning the _Owner_ should not be able to break the site OR taking for responsabilities if doing so.
